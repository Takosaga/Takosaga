### [Evaluating the Consistency of Explainable AI Methods in Hate Speech Detection](https://github.com/Takosaga/master_thesis)

Challenge: LIME and SHAP are XAI methods used to explain AI models that detect hatespeech. Which is better base on conistency metrics?
Results: SHAP provided consitent results compared to LIME, so recommendation is to use SHAP.

Developed research to evaluate the consistency of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods in hate speech detection across multiple social media platforms. This master's thesis project addresses transparency needs in content detection by systematically comparing LIME and SHAP explanation techniques using rigorous quantitative methodologies.

Results demonstrate that SHAP outperforms LIME in explanation stability, achieving perfect or near-perfect scores across all three consistency metrics (Jaccard similarity, Spearman's œÅ, and Kendall's œÑb). While LIME exhibited moderate consistency with scores between 0.65-0.80, SHAP maintained reproducibility with scores of 1.0 across different random seeds.

* Multi-Platform Data Integration: Aggregated and standardized hate speech datasets from Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and Gab, ensuring diverse representation across different social media contexts and target demographics.
* XAI Implementation: Integrated LIME and SHAP explanation frameworks with CardiffNLP's RoBERTa-based hate speech detection model, developing controlled experimental setups to isolate stochasticity effects on explanation consistency.
* Statistical Evaluation: Applied multiple consistency metrics including Jaccard Similarity, Spearman Correlation, and Kendall Tau-b, demonstrating that SHAP provides significantly more consistent explanations than LIME across prediction scenarios.
* Visualization: Created heatmap visualizations and consistency matrices to represent explanation behavior, supporting both quantitative findings and intuitive understanding of XAI method performance.
* Key Skills: Explainable AI (LIME/SHAP), Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, Research Methodology, Python
